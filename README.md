Flash
=====

A trait class for delayed cache object loading. Object unique keys are identifiable references to objects and are stored in Flash until needed. Objects are retrieved from cache and/or specified anonymous function when data other than the unique key is requested. This method allows for automated, grouped data pulling from a central location.

Usage of this code is not recommended for anything outside of the code demonstration on GitHub.
